<h2>The origin story of the Software Developers Journey podcast</h2>
<p>
  <p>In 2014, after leading pre-screening interviewing for a customer, and rejecting every candidate they suggested, Tim started questioning his skills, sanity, and expectations. So he decided to interview successful developers he knew. He wanted to know what skills matter to them, what mindset attracts them, and what a successful developer might be. Their answers contained their life stories, and those were amazing. So he decided to record them. Thus, the Software Developers Journey podcast -or "DevJourney"- was born. What ensued was a series of interviews with developers from all over the world, series that opened his eyes to the diversity of paths and profiles our industry has to offer. Each journey is unique and has something to teach us. Come onboard and give it a try!</p>
