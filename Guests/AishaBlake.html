<p>Aisha first walked us through the Musical-Conference she is putting up. Then we scrolled back to the place software entered her life. We then talked about her volunteering at the Cristo Rey High school and then in the Jesuit Volunteer Corps. We discussed how this formed her teaching skills as well as letting her dig deeper into software development. We talked about her bootcamp and how teaching came full circle into her life. We discussed pairing and exploring and finished on a high note, talking about the art of transferring knowledge effectively.</p><p>Aisha Blake is an Application Developer at Detroit Labs currently building &lt;title of conf&gt;, a musical tech extravaganza. She co-organizes self.conference and „Detroit Speakers in Tech“. She approaches speaking and teaching as a way to give others the tools to shine as brightly as they can. In her spare time, she sings karaoke and pets dogs. Aisha is a champion of feedback, fierce accessibility advocate, and a steward of strong and joyful teams.<br><br><b>Here are the links of the show:</b></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.twitter.com/AishaBlake">https://www.twitter.com/AishaBlake</a></li><li><a href="https://aisha.codes/title-of-conf">https://aisha.codes/title-of-conf</a></li><li><a href="http://titleofconf.org/">http://titleofconf.org</a></li><li><a href="http://grandcircus.co">http://grandcircus.co</a></li><li><a href="http://vakila.github.io/">Anjana Vakil</a></li><li><a href="https://www.jesuitvolunteers.org/">Jesuit Volunteer Corps</a></li><li><a href="https://www.detroitcristorey.org/">Detroit Cristo Rey High School</a></li></ul><p><b>Credits</b></p><ul><li>Music <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Yung_Kartz/August_2018/Aye">Aye</a> by <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Yung_Kartz/">Yung Kartz</a> is licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License</a>.</li></ul><p><b>Your host</b><br><br>Software Developer‘s Journey is hosted and produced by Timothée (Tim) Bourguignon, a crazy frenchman living in Germany who dedicated his life to helping others learn &amp; grow.
