    <p>
        <h3>Introduction and Early Life (00:00)</h3>
Shannon Kendall, began her journey in an entirely different industry. She initially pursued acting, gaining a degree in Theater and Film, and worked in the entertainment industry in Los Angeles for a decade. However, <b>an unexpected turning point occurred when she discovered the world of coding.</b>

<h3>Finding Inspiration and The Learning Process (05:11)</h3>
Shannon discovered their passion for coding following a friend who had enrolled in a Bootcamp. Intrigued, Shannon started learning programming using the learning platform Treehouse. Their first experience with coding was <b>exciting and engaging, similar to the feeling of "falling down a rabbit hole".</b> Shannon further bolstered their learning with resources like FreeCodeCamp and YouTube tutorials.

<h3>Overcoming Challenges and Breaking into Tech (09:47)</h3>
Shannon highlighted the importance of problem-solving and resourcefulness in development. Learning to code was challenging and sometimes frustrating, but she realized that finding solutions to problems was a crucial part of the job. she started applying for jobs and landed their first role at a startup after a year and a half of self-study. Shannon underlines that <b>"It's less about the speed at which you learn and more about the determination to keep trying, keep learning, and to be resilient."</b>

<h3>Understanding Developer Evangelism and Aligning Career Goals (14:23)</h3>
Shannon initially considered becoming a developer evangelist, but she later realized it wasn't compatible with their lifestyle. The constant travel and high-demand nature of the role wasn't what she wanted. Instead, she focused on improving their coding skills and exploring other areas of tech. Shannon suggests that <b>"it's important to continuously check in with yourself, reevaluate your career goals, and understand that she can change over time."</b>

<h3>Applying Soft Skills to Coding (17:05)</h3>
Despite transitioning from acting to coding, Shannon emphasized that her theater background was not wasted. She discussed how <b>acting skills such as teamwork, communication, and understanding people's emotions were all beneficial in the coding world.</b> These "soft skills" played a significant role in code review processes, empathizing with users, and working within a team.

<h3>Encouraging Inclusivity (21:28)</h3>
Shannon enjoys the supportive work environment and the culture of learning. She has also been actively involved in promoting diversity and inclusion in the tech industry, including participating in an ERG (Employee Resource Group) for queer individuals. Shannon believes that <b>creating an inclusive work environment is essential, not only for employees but also for fostering creativity and productivity.</b>

<h3>Encouraging Others to Enter Tech (27:42)</h3>
Shannon encourages others interested in tech to give it a try, stressing that <b>there are no specific prerequisites for learning to code.</b> she highlighted that even their wife, who initially felt that coding was too technical, started to enjoy learning CSS and HTML. She stresses that anyone can learn to code, and that self-doubt should not be a barrier.

<h3>Reevaluating Your Dream and Being Open to Change (34:11)</h3>
Shannon advises those in the tech field to continuously reevaluate their career aspirations and give themselves permission to change. It is crucial to understand your wants and needs as they evolve. Your career is much more about who you are as a person than how quickly you can debug something. <b>Shannon emphasizes that "all previous experiences matter," as they all contribute to who you are and what you bring to your role.</b>
