    <p>
        Our latest podcast episode features an enlightening conversation with Alexandra Spalato, a woman whose career path has been anything but ordinary. Having transitioned from being a pharmacist, actress and businesswoman to a successful software developer and business owner, her journey serves as an inspiration to many who dream of a career in tech.
        </p><p>
        Alexandra's journey began in the world of pharmacy, a profession she quickly realized was not her calling. She found her calling in acting, but she did not manage to make it a full-time career. She then transitioned into business, dabbling in various industries before finding her passion in software development. Her transition into the tech industry was fueled by her insatiable thirst for learning and an ability to quickly adapt to new environments.
    </p><p>
        What makes Alexandra's journey remarkable is her determination and commitment to continuous learning. Her initial foray into the world of software development was self-taught, where she delved into WordPress. Recognizing the need to further upgrade her skills, she decided to immerse herself in a JavaScript bootcamp.
    </p><p>
        Her mentor, Zac Gordon, played a pivotal role in shaping her success. His course on JavaScript for WordPress helped lay the foundation for her successful career in software development. Alexandra credits much of her accomplishments to Gordon, highlighting the importance of mentorship in career growth.
    </p><p>
        However, being a software developer wasn't enough for Alexandra. She desired more, leading her to start her own business. This new venture came with its fair share of challenges, from dealing with imposter syndrome to managing toxic projects. Yet, these experiences provided valuable lessons that have helped her grow both personally and professionally.
    </p><p>
        In spite of the hurdles, Alexandra was able to turn her passions into a successful product, leading to a fruitful career at Storyblok. Her story provides valuable insights into the world of web development, offering encouragement to those considering a similar career path.
    </p><p>
        Alexandra's story is not just about career transition, but also about embracing change and chasing passions. Her experiences highlight the potential for success when one is willing to step out of their comfort zone and embrace new challenges. It's a reminder that unconventional paths can lead to extraordinary destinations.
    </p><p>
        Her journey, though unconventional, is a testament to the power of passion and dedication. It serves as a reminder that success is not confined to a specific path and that it's never too late to pursue your passion. It's about finding what you love to do, and doing it well.
