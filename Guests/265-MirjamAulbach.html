<div><h2>Highlights</h2>
    <p>
        <h3>Start of the Journey & The Intersection of Coding and Social Work (4:46)</h3>
Mirjam Aulbach started her journey in a field entirely unrelated to software development, in accounting and then dog training, yet she found herself drawn to the logic and creativity of programming. She acknowledges the importance of understanding the dynamics of the <b>human mind and emotions</b> in software development and communication within a team.
<h3>The Role of Side Projects (12:40)</h3>
Mirjam highlights the significance of <b>side projects</b> for learning and exploring new areas. She discusses her side project 'Conference Buddy,' where she built a platform for people who want to attend tech conferences but are hesitant to go alone. These endeavors offer unique opportunities for junior developers to gain practical experience, learn new technologies, and take ownership of their projects.
<h3>Transition into Full-time Developer (19:28)</h3>
Mirjam elaborates on her shift from being a dog trainer to a full-time software developer, emphasizing the impact of having a mentor and her self-study. She leveraged online platforms like FreeCodeCamp, and engaged in coding meetups and Twitter coding community for learning and support. Her journey underlines the importance of <b>continuous learning and community support</b> in personal growth and career development.
<h3>Importance of Testing (38:12)</h3>
Mirjam discusses her focus on testing in development. She underscores that testing is a critical part of the development process, focusing mostly on the unit and integration levels. She believes that every team needs someone who understands how to break things and ensure a strong testing safety net. This experience emphasizes the value of <b>software testing</b> and its integral role in the development process.
<h3>Understanding Human Behavior and Emotions (42:35)</h3>
Toward the end of the conversation, Mirjam revisits the theme of understanding human behavior and emotions. She encourages junior developers to develop kindness and compassion for others, acknowledging that people's experiences and feelings can differ vastly. This understanding is essential not just for team dynamics, but also for creating <b>user-oriented software solutions</b>.
<h3>Open Source Development Challenges (42:10)</h3>
Mirjam discusses her current role at VMware working on an open-source product. She describes the unique challenges involved, particularly lacking direct access to end-user interactions. These insights shed light on the distinct dynamics of <b>open-source development</b> and adapting testing strategies accordingly.
