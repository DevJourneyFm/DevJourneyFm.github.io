<p>Greg first told us about his need for creating things, building things and expressing himself through products. We then talked about his studdies and how he ended up working for Mozilla. Greg told us a lot about what he learned there, what he liked and why he decided to move on. He then told us about the consulting part of his career and how this all was the perfect build up to create his company ReadMe. We then discussed ReadMe itself, the 5 years when the company was profitable and bootstrapped and the (very) recent Series-A funding it received. We finally went full circle and finished on a note about creativity.</p><p><br></p><p>After launching dozens of companies and side-projects over the last 10 years, Greg realized how difficult API’s were to understand and use for most people. That’s why, as Founder of ReadMe, he is making it easy for millions of people and over 17 hundred companies, including Lyft and Trello, to build and use awesome products with API’s.<br><br><b>Here are the links of the show:</b></p><ul><li>Greg on Twitter <a href="https://www.twitter.com/gkoberger">https://www.twitter.com/gkoberger</a></li><li>Greg's Company ReadMe <a href="https://readme.com">https://readme.com</a></li><li>Babe Ruth reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babe_Ruth%27s_called_shot">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babe_Ruth%27s_called_shot</a></li><li>API Mixtape Conference <a href="https://apimixtape.com">https://apimixtape.com</a></li><li>Mixtape Songs: <a href="https://apimixtape.com/music">https://apimixtape.com/music</a></li><li>API World Conference in San Jose <a href="https://apiworld.co">https://apiworld.co<br></a><br></li></ul><p><b>Credits</b></p><ul><li>Closing Song "<a href="https://apimixtape.com/music">GET /rich or Die Tryin’</a>" by POST Malone and Greg Koberger</li><li>Music <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Yung_Kartz/August_2018/Aye">Aye</a> by <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Yung_Kartz/">Yung Kartz</a> is licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License</a>.</li></ul><p><b>Your host</b><br><br>Software Developer‘s Journey is hosted and produced by Timothée (Tim) Bourguignon, a crazy frenchman living in Germany who dedicated his life to helping others learn &amp; grow.
