<div><h2>Highlights</h2>
    <p>
        <h3>Early Challenges and Overcoming Obstacles (05:12)</h3>
        Chelsea Troy begins by discussing her initial encounters with programming and the struggles she faced. Despite being discouraged by a teacher who told her she lacked the 'intellectual firepower' for programming, she remained determined and pursued her interest. <b>She learnt that adversity can fuel one's determination to succeed and that naysayers shouldn't determine one's future.</b>
        <h3>Moving towards Data Science (10:55)</h3>
        Chelsea then segued into data science. She felt it was a natural transition from her studies in neuroscience. <b>She emphasized the importance of being open to new avenues and the value of applying skills from one domain to another.</b>
        <h3>Tech Industry Culture and Diversity (19:40)</h3>
        Chelsea critically analyzed the culture within the tech industry, pointing out the lack of diversity and inclusivity. She suggested that individuals, especially underrepresented ones, should <b>find a supportive community</b>, where they can grow and learn without feeling isolated or marginalized. 
        <h3>Teaching and Pedagogical Approaches (22:23)</h3>
        As a teacher, Chelsea spoke passionately about her pedagogical approach. She argued for the need for accessible pedagogy and maintaining a learner-centered approach. <b>She advises teachers to design classes that are accessible to students who find the information challenging, as it is these students who need teachers the most.</b>
        <h3>Dealing with Imposter Syndrome (32:11)</h3>
        Chelsea provided insights on dealing with imposter syndrome, which many junior developers experience. She suggested <b>creating a personal "brag document" to remind oneself of achievements and competencies</b> to overcome feelings of inadequacy. 
        <h3>Book Recommendations and Continuous Learning (40:58)</h3>
        In the realm of continuous learning, Chelsea offered various book recommendations, from 'Working Effectively with Legacy Code' to 'Living Documentation' and more. She stressed the importance of considering the context when introducing patterns in coding and the need to balance the benefits and drawbacks. <b>She strongly advocates for continuous learning and exploration of different perspectives.</b>
        <h3>Advice for Students and Teachers (46:22)</h3>
        Finally, Chelsea offered advice for both students and teachers. She advised students who've been discouraged by a teacher to seek out better educators who prioritize accessible teaching methods. For teachers, she emphasized the importance of designing a classroom that's accessible for all learners. <b>She believes that when we design for those who have the hardest time accessing something, we make it more accessible for everyone.</b>
