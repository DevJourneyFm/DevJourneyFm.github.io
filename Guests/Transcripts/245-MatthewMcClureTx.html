I think people used to think about like, real time is a very different type of video. Like it kind of wasn't thought
about as video for years, there's like, live and on demand. And then like, real time is a very specific thing that you
would talk about otherwise. And then I would honestly talk it up to some point during the pandemic, like, when people
say, like, Oh, I'm working. I want to add video to my app. It could literally mean any kind of video, real time on
demand live, and the lines between them, especially if you're somebody that doesn't come from the ecosystem, I have
learned so much. And now we do all support three. And so I think actually, we're finally to that dream that we had in
2016. To be able to say, like, I don't want to do another video. Let me go check them off stocks. They can probably help
and like that's like, yeah, it's it's mostly true and broad strokes, which is really fun.

And now back to today's guest.

Matt, as you know, the show exists to help listeners understand what your story looked like and imagine how to shape
their own future. So as is usual on the show, let's go back to you beginnings. Where would you place the start of your
journey?

</p><p><b>Matthew McClure 2:31</b></br>
Yeah, that's a as when you when you first pose that as kind of the opening question that took me down. I'm trying to
remember the order of operations for some of this. But yeah, I think if I'm thinking about like the very, very
beginning, I don't even know if my brother in law would know this. But I'm the youngest by 10 years in my family, so my
oldest sister's 15 years older than I am. And so her husband I've known him since like, basically, effectively birth but
he worked at a startup and kind of the first tech comm tech.com boom in the late 90s And I remember the very first time
when they rereleased the Star Wars like I you know, I had been into computers a little bit of a nerd. And this is like
when I first got into tech is like thinking about like wow, like that is such that is so cool. Like these people like I
remember he took me to go see the midnight showing when they rereleased the Star Wars like the remastered Star Wars
editions. And so he took me with his his startup that he was working working with, they took me to the midnight showing,
which was such a huge deal because my parents would never like as way past my bedtime stay up late. And I remember there
are these like, you know, like big overweight guys with wearing white, like the white robes and like cinnamon rolls
taped to the sides of their head to be layup and they had gotten their way early to stand in front of the line. And then
they like, got in there and like stood with like fake lightsabers like guarding to two rows. So the rest of the company
could like sit together and these two rows and there's just this like weird group of they're all so except it was just
like these, these are like these are these are my people these are you know, I'm like 11 at the time 12. And so then
fast forward fast forward a you know, a year or two and I started to get really into this flash cartoon called Eskimo
Bob. Which I know I know or like a little bit of it. I'd gotten into this I'd gotten to this last cartoon called Eskimo
Bob which if you're familiar with like Homestar Runner I think is a little bit of a precursor to Homestar Runner, a
little bit more niche never never never got the escape velocity of Homestar Runner So weird flash cartoon, they had a,
they had a chat box on the website that would click just like a web based IRC client. And so I started chatting in there
on the web, and then eventually went from there to like a desktop IRC client. And then suddenly, I'm spending like, all
my time in this IRC client, in this IRC channel, Eskimo Bob on Freenode. And that kind of, I don't know, from there, I
kind of started getting into building websites. And I think I'd maybe dabbled in a little bit more. But that was kind of
really everybody else in there was a nerd. And so suddenly, I'm spending a lot of time. Like, I don't know, building
things, hacking and building mIRC, plugins, all that sort of stuff. And around this time, I think there was either right
before this, or during this I, I was homeschooled, so I was homeschooled from for fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh
grade. And so in seventh grade, my parents got me a laptop, and my curriculum was all on CD ROMs. So I immediately
figured out how to bypass the parental, like the teacher controls and lock you into the, the application. And so I would
spend, you know, 45 minutes gunning through whatever things I had to do, and like deleting and retaking tests, don't,
don't tell my mom deleting your retaking tests over and over again, until I got the grade, that would be acceptable and
like, so that I could go back online and like go, you know, hack around on websites, or build these stupid mIRC plugins,
or, you know, chat with folks on IRC or whatever. Like, at one point, I was, I was ran like a little hosting company, it
was ridiculous. But so yeah, that that, that that year, I think was I probably learned very, very little of what I was
supposed to do on those CD ROMs. But I would, I would call that year of being homeschooled is probably the most
formative moment of my, of my career. Because I was basically nonstop you know, learning learning how to program and my
brother in law kind of reentered the picture there. Because he saw me like really getting super interested in all this.
And he's getting me books on Visual Basic, and I learned how to program PHP at the time, like all these things. And so I
think he saw me, he saw me starting to get interested in it. And he, you know, he was the one that kind of pushed me a
little bit further on, on learning how to do these things.

</p><p><b>Tim Bourguignon 7:29</b></br>
So fed the fire fed the

</p><p><b>Matthew McClure 7:31</b></br>
fire. Yeah.

</p><p><b>Tim Bourguignon 7:33</b></br>
Besides, besides having found your people, as you as you painted it, do you remember what what what kept you so
interested in this whole?

</p><p><b>Matthew McClure 7:43</b></br>
Ah, man, it's just the, the blank slate of it all was so fun to me. So I mean, I think like the, the shortly after that,
so before be before the homeschooling bit, and like really kind of like, really, really getting into it. For some reason
I had gotten to become PHP early on, and I just remember the thought of like, if I, if I can imagine something that I
want to build, like, I can go build it. And like being able to, like, write some of this, write some code and HTML, CSS,
and then like, put together these terrible table based layouts of the of the late 90s and early 2000s. But thinking it
was like, wow, like, I can do anything here. And so it wasn't as much like a I think a lot of people are really excited
about like, the problem to solve, like, thinking about as a problem solving piece, which, which excites me, I think
that's fun, but I think especially at the time, What really excited me about it was like, do it like writing some code,
whatever hitting refresh, and that thing that I had done was like there and like there's something so special and fun
about this, this act of creation. That also at the time was so niche, like, none of my friends were doing it. I didn't
really know anybody else that did except for maybe my brother in law. And so it also felt like, uniquely mine, like I
could I had I had paint brushes and canvas that like I didn't know anybody else that had that. And it was so much fun.
Yeah,

</p><p><b>Tim Bourguignon 9:37</b></br>
it makes so much sense to see your your dreamy face when you're when you're remembering all this. It's, it's it sounds
to be a nice place to where you're where you were at.

</p><p><b>Matthew McClure 9:48</b></br>
Yeah, it was beautiful. It really was. It was a Yeah, I just remember, you know, and none of my friends care like and
all this stuff looks terrible. So I remember like, you know, I would go right I BMX bikes and skateboard and rollerblade
or whatever my friends do the jumps are shit about, like about the, you know, the new web app that I built, which we
didn't call it that at the time, or the IRC plugin or whatever else. But this like friend group that I had, especially
like, then then kind of this like, the Eskimo Bob IRC crew comes in and like those those folks were, like, they were
always like, yeah, holy crap, like, wow, cool. Like, you know, and that was a, it was it was funny, because I think that
my friend group bifurcated a little bit. Like I had my online friends and my in person, friends, my online friends,
cared a lot and showed a lot of interest in these things that I built. It's not like my real friends wouldn't have cared
if I showed them. But it was just like, we were way too busy. You know, nearly breaking our arms doing something dumb.
And because I had all this time, especially dirt like that's why I say it's like such a hockey stick of like, what I
learned and builds and experienced was just because while they were at school, I was hanging out with the the online
friends all the time, then they would get home and I'd sign off and go do things outside for the rest of the day.

</p><p><b>Tim Bourguignon 11:20</b></br>
At which one, does two groups merged together?

</p><p><b>Matthew McClure 11:25</b></br>
I don't I still don't know if they ever have. I mean, at some point work. Like, when I moved to San Francisco, I would
say is when that when that group merged a little bit more. Maybe Maybe a touch in college. But yeah, I think I'm part of
that's probably a symptom of like my, like, I have always played ice hockey, played from like 10 years old, which is
weird to the grip of Georgia. There's also like, my sister's involved in that again, because she lived in cold places,
but I played high Sacramento, I played through college. And so like, if there's one group of people that I can tell you
definitely gave very, very few did not care about my web app. It was definitely my ice hockey teammates. Generally
speaking, they got again late later, later, like my friends in college cared and there are some nerds on that team. But
like, yeah, that was that was not a crew that overlapped very heavily with the with my, let's go program squad.

</p><p><b>Tim Bourguignon 12:34</b></br>
You were talking about college? Would you? Do you pick a CS degree? Or is it a CS related College?

</p><p><b>Matthew McClure 12:40</b></br>
No, no. So that's actually so are there. Yeah, so I and this probably boils down to like what I was talking about around
like I loved building and I love programming and I love building websites. And I you know, I did some of it for I just
took some freelance jobs I would do I would build websites for family friends and businesses and you know, I did some
like, quote it work and quote for my for my dad's office and like little things like that. But it was it was like an it
was an act of love as a hobby. Like I this was like, this was my like safe place isn't the right word. But it was just
like it was my like, it was this thing that brought me a lot of joy and quiet in my life. And I'd heard you know, like,
I'd gotten bad advice from some folks along the way around, like, don't make you know, like, I didn't want to ruin my
hobby. I didn't want to ruin this amazing thing by making it my job. I didn't want to hate programming at any point in
time. I didn't want to hate computers. So I actually avoided them. It never even crossed my mind to try and do something
with computers in college. Like I went to school and I was pre med when I first got there. Then absolutely hated the
first like bio of course, like bio in high school. I'd love bio college friggin hated freshman year. So like, this isn't
for me, I like, you know, went to like poli sci or something like that. And then somebody was just like, you know what
you should just like, if you don't if you're not sure what you should do at this point, like, go to business school. And
like, I'd always been entrepreneurial. Like I'd started like, I had this. What about one of the web apps that I built?
When I was when I was you know, 1213 years old. And I was I was very edgy punk kid as many 13 year olds are. And I had
started this clothing company called anti-fashion. Very original, very cool. And yeah, I am I'd ask you to get that out,
I need to, like do some research and make sure that you can't find anything there later. But I want to make sure that
I'm not like dockable on like, some terrible like website that I made when I was 15. So yeah, the I had started this,
like, terrible fashion thing. And like, at the time, I was, like, you know, you would I would exacto knife, I actually
had a really fun way of making T shirts and whatever, I won't get the details of how I was doing it. But like, I'd make
these terrible like T shirt designs, stuff like that. And then like, one of my initial forays like trying to like build
like a website to sell them. And that was actually like, later this would come around as a moment of like, Stripe didn't
exist then. And so if you wanted to accept credit card payments, you had to like you would you would go sign up for a
gateway, but then you had to go to a bank. So anyway, so it's like you had authorized net, but you still had to have the
bank to actually be anyway. So it's kind of a non starter. Which later came in play when like, I found straight, like
when stripe entered the picture, you know, and whatever. 2009 or something like that. And I remember being like, oh my
god, like, this is so cool. Like, wow, like, and it was that moment was like, Holy crap. Like, you know, so anyway, 15
year old me did not figure out except

they're probably younger at the time, like 13. Gosh, where was I going with that? Why did we start down that path?

</p><p><b>Tim Bourguignon 16:27</b></br>
You were talking about? If you're not sure what to do, Goosby.

</p><p><b>Matthew McClure 16:31</b></br>
Oh, yeah. Okay, so So you know, anyway, whatever. I'd started this like fashion company. I was trying to sell those you
know, again, I've done some freelance stuff, but like, so I was I was always entrepreneurial I wanted I enjoyed starting
companies I enjoy or companies I enjoyed, like, doing entrepreneurial things. It sounds like yeah, business school
totally makes sense. Like, so I went to business school. And yeah, just kind of like go on a path. Like honestly, like,
by my junior year, I was mostly thinking like, oh, you know, I'll go work for like a, like, when at some business
consulting thing at a school like, I like traveling, like I'll do a few years down the road warrior thing before
figuring out what's next, you know, because like the big like consulting firms like recruited really heavily I went to
University of Georgia, so it's Terry College of Business can all the Big Four and all consulting companies like really
recruit heavily out of there? So I was like, Yeah, sure. That's easy. It's like the next step is like I don't fully know
for sure what I want my what industry I want to go to a recruiter. So this is like a great way of like getting exposure
to bunch of stuff at once. Like, I'll be honest, like, at that point, I was just like, I didn't know I didn't know what
I want to do next. There's this pivotal moment, I think it was my it was either the saw the summer after my my during
the summer after my junior year. See the summer after my junior year, summer after my sophomore year at the US junior
year. I had studied abroad. And so I was staying in a staying in Athens for the summer and I needed I needed. Like I
usually I'd work when I'd go back home to Augusta, but I wanted a job in Athens. And so I wanted to get it during the
school year, so I could go into it. And I remember my buddy's cousin like owned a hookah shop in downtown Athens. hookah
hookup. And they just needed somebody like, you know, like a cashier, somebody run the door. And like, you know, I knew
other people that work there. And he the owner, like every is really nice. It's one of those jobs where it's like, it's
easy, like foot traffic that, you know, traffic's relatively low. So it's like, go in there, you read your book, you
know, maybe think around on the computer for a while. And just you know, help folks when they come in, like, like, as
far as part time, part time college kid work like, that is easy to great. And on a whim, I'd realize there's a really
cool, at least I thought it was cool. There's a really cool web development agency in Athens called Plexus. You know,
they built a bunch of like the local like a bunch of the cool local business websites and stuff like that. I'd heard of
them. And I pass it on the way home and for some reason, maybe it's not the student newspaper or something, but they
they were hiring. Like, oh, like, I don't know, maybe for like a part time summer job. Like, give that a try. And I
remember going in and interviewing and the guy asked me some questions and we're, we're talking and you know, I
mentioned like, yeah, probably like grabbed jQuery and whatever do this that blah, blah and like, so they end up hiring
me on the spot for this job. Hey, And I freaking loved it. It was so much fun. So much fun that like, you know, I'm
weeks into this job and I'm trying to figure how to change my major at that point. I was like, that whole thing about
not making my hubby My job was the stupidest that like this, this job is awesome. I want to do this for ever, like, all
of that fun that it had with building and like making things a reality. Now I'm doing that with a great designer that
knows what they're doing. And they're like, I'm working with people and like making client realities come true. And
she's like, this shit rules like Why wouldn't I want How could I not have wanted to do this? Forever? Oh my god, like,
which is funny to think like if I hadn't done that job and I just like gone and worked at the hookah hookah shop. What
would I be? I don't mean as an offense to anybody who shop ever but I'm just very curious, like where my life had been
if I hadn't had that like aha moment. So I'm like trying to change my major I'm talking to like, I'm like frantically
calling my advisor being like, how do I like how do I get in CS? Like, how do I switch everything go to CES and they
were just like, Okay, well first, start at your freshman year and take a very different math class. Starting there.
Okay, so basically your four years out if you want to start there, it's like okay, junior year, probably don't start at
semester two freshman year again, got it. Okay, what are my other options? So I ended up taking like, there's a you
know, a technical major within so I ended up double majoring in Business School adding like, management information
systems, which, you know, it's not, it's not CS, but like, it was at least tactical and fun. I ended up getting really
into the, like, entrepreneurial, like there was like a, a startup incubator tech nerd community in downtown Athens I
started getting more involved in started a company with some folks that we can get into like, whatever that end up
looking like end up making a bunch of friends with folks that kind of in the CS department, so they let me kind of like,
they wait. They wait a bunch of requirements. Let me take some some CS courses that I absolutely wasn't. Didn't have the
prereqs for which was a lot of fun. But yeah, that was that was kind of my path like I was, I went from being like
really anti I don't want to I don't want to ruin this. I want this to be my hobby. I don't think it really had a clear
picture of what it would even look like as a job. And then yeah, it was all thanks like Plexus, like a little rails
consultancy in Athens, Georgia, just like completely blew my mind and turned my life upside down. And like, awesome.

</p><p><b>Tim Bourguignon 22:55</b></br>
Yesterday. Your smile again? Well, you're you're telling this, it really comes from the heart. So that that sounds
really, really awesome. Yeah, it was. Yeah,

</p><p><b>Matthew McClure 23:06</b></br>
it was really special.

</p><p><b>Tim Bourguignon 23:08</b></br>
So how did you rebound after that? You say, studying to to visit? meetups, this incubator. Did you have an idea how to
how to start this career?

</p><p><b>Matthew McClure 23:22</b></br>
You I mean, again, so I think even even after that I didn't really know like, I didn't know what was next. I just knew
that. Like, I wanted to keep pulling on this. All that mattered to me was keep it continuing to pull on this thread.
Like, I didn't know what it meant, but it's just like working with like, I felt like I just remember feeling so dumb. I
feel I felt so dumb when I finally like when it when it clicked they're just like this is this is this is your job. Like
how could you ever have thought that you should do anything else other than work with computers every day? And I
remember I think even some of my like my roommates and friends were just like, oh yeah, you're finally doing that. Like

okay

</p><p><b>Tim Bourguignon 24:05</b></br>
that's what friends are for. Right?

</p><p><b>Matthew McClure 24:08</b></br>
Like, it was like you know they Oh yeah, we got like I think they all thought I had some other reason for not doing it.
Oh, cool. You finally figured it out how good you so even then, like still like then it just kind of like the initial
thing was like it was a bit of a pivot and like what kind of consulting I would do it's like okay, well now we'll go be
like an IT consultant for a few years and the same before and figured out whatever. And so a brother's friend of mine.
Again, my brother is like 13 years older than like so my sister the fifth 115 years older that has the brother the
brother in law that was so formative. My older brother's 13 years old and I'm so he had a he had a friend that was kind
of in Athens and the friend all again, I'd been doing all this since I was like you know, really pretty young. So like
my brothers Friends all knew me as the nerd like Chad's nerdy little brother that does computer shit. That was kind of
like, I think the general like vibe that like the the ethos that the friends knew. Yeah. So he came to me with this idea
around like mobile ordering. Keep in mind time, this is probably 2011 2010 2011. And he's like, I got this idea for like
mobile ordering. iPhones were still pretty brand new. And he was like, well, people use these phones, like for what if
people could use their phones to order and in restaurants. And in retrospect, it was actually kind of ahead of its time,
it was like we would we had like, I designed these QR codes, it would go on the table. And that's how you would like
start your start your tab and you could order your food there. And then we took it out, we took it around. And we built
like a prototype took around shop that around us some. So we ended up kind of like starting a company around it. And
joining that incubator in Athens, we were one of the inaugural companies that were accepted into this like little tech
incubator in Athens for this mobile ordering system. built all the prototypes are taking all the restaurants. That's
like, you know, how would you like to be, like known about these things? And they're like, I was like, would you they're
like it has to come into our system. And I was like, but what if there was like a printer next to it or something like
that they would print off orders. And you could take it that way. They're like, No, like, we're not gonna pay attention
anything else, if these things come in, and we're not like they're not in our point of sale system, they're definitely
gonna get ignored. There's like, okay, crap. And so then like me, being a brilliant college student with with decades of
experience was like, I know, we'll build a point of sale system. That's the answer. And turns out that was not, I don't
think that was quite the right move, either. And also, as an aside, now, it was really frustrating, you know, a decade
plus later walking into like, you walk into a restaurant now there's like, 40 iPads next to the point of sale system
from all like DoorDash, UberEATS. And just like, you're jerks totally, would have handled something next to your points,
I guess, minor difference in like, how much volume they provide, but whatever.

</p><p><b>Tim Bourguignon 27:15</b></br>
And how much pressure there? Yeah,

</p><p><b>Matthew McClure 27:17</b></br>
yeah, exactly. And so we ended up on like, on a weekend, I'd hacked around with like, a shared music sharing system. So
like anybody could add music to a queue, and it would play on like my computer. And I remember kind of showing this to
my, to the guy, my co founder that this mobile race like, this is incredible. And we kind of pivoted the whole company
around like building a jukebox, this jukebox system and it sounds it sounds weird, but it actually makes a lot of sense.
Like the, all of the bars and restaurants at the time ran all their music off of a local computer behind the bar. And
because it was local music, you pay a single like kept licensing fee. So as long as like you pay like your public
performance fee of 100 bucks a month or whatever. But it's not like you're licensing each song or whatever. But as long
as it comes from that machine, like it's kind of fair game. And so we were we were able to it was kind of this weird
loophole where we wouldn't have to get into the licensing game, which is where everything gets really hard difficult
with using it. So as long as I could build this application that would let us control though that local music. So
pivoted, the whole company went from when from mobile ordering to a point of sale system to effectively a mobile
jukebox. And seemed like things were actually kind of working like we're in a few restaurants and bars, it's kind of
exciting. But then every night you could watch like, our, our song requests go to like midnight, and then just drop off,
like to zero. And I was like why? Like ever, like across the board. It happened everywhere. It's like what in the world.
And so we started saying, like, you're just hanging out near the bar near that computer to see what was happening at
midnight, where these things were just dropping off. And around that time every night was when people started accepting,
like, requesting like, whatever that the hot, whatever the hits were from, like, you know, the that week, that month,
you know, whatever those kind of hits were and so the bartenders would go back there and just shut off whatever the
music like our app and just open up YouTube or whatever else at the time and just start playing like which, you know,
the music industry did not approve of but it didn't matter so like anyway. So it just didn't quite didn't quite work
out. And so at that point, I had been working at a I had gotten kind of poached from the through that like the that
incubator network I'd gotten poached by this A guy that ran like a an AV company that did a lot of like smartboard
installs AV stuff at the university to to run their software arm basically like not run, but like to start building out
their this, they wanted to start doing a lot more software. It hired myself and this other guy, Adam, to do all of that.
And so that's that's how I met Adam. Now he's one of my co founders here. And here in Georgia, we started working on
some video stuff. There, we need to like research it. And then that's how I found Zencoder, which was in kind of that
first round with Dev Tools. And I remember seeing Zencoder on AngelList at the time had like a really funny angel list
at the time had like a, a tender for startups kind of thing. And so you could like swipe right swipe left. And like
startups he thought were cool. And I suppose encoder product, but it's cool. Like I tried to Open Source Player, I, you
know, we had evaluated using it for this, like live streaming thing we needed, it didn't quite work, because because of
our needs, but like it was still interesting. And so I just like swipe drivers, that's cool company. And then like,
John, another one of my current co founders, he was the CEO of Zencoder reached out in within, like, within a month.
Within a month, I think I moved to San Francisco. And then I convinced them to join a few months after that. And that's
kinda that's kind of the, at least how I got got to this stage of my career. Or at least like the beginning of the stage
of my career,

</p><p><b>Tim Bourguignon 31:40</b></br>
which is still the current stage more or less, I mean, in terms of video and being in San Francisco and

</p><p><b>Matthew McClure 31:48</b></br>
yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. And so when I first I remember when I moved out here, we had been doing some video stuff with at
that AV company, like, the last thing that I was working on, before I moved out here was like, there's like a, there's a
system for your building is basically a way for professors to run final exams for like med students. So like cadaver,
cadaver surgeries for like that final exam, or whatever. And so we would stream the surgery itself, the cadaver surgery,
and then like, show the on demand afterwards. But then the professor could like make comments in there and you could
anyway. So that's why I'd been like working with live streaming player. And so I had dabbled in video very, like that
was like, my first foray. Other than that, like I knew I had trans I knew quite a bit about encoding video. Yeah, there
are some, there are some communities that were very into high quality videos online. That were totally question like,
had questionable rights to the content? Well, we'll say that. But what they did have was amazing, like, because they
were like super uptight, around quality like that would get you kicked out. If you uploaded a not movie, that would get
you kicked out. But keep in mind, this is like 15 years ago at this point. I'm pretty sure the statute of limitations
has passed at this point. But what what they did have on these committees was amazing guides for for transcoding. And so
it was like, these are the different like, Okay, if it's interlaced content, this is how you need to handle it. Blah,
blah. And then like, if you didn't, if you didn't transcode the content to those standards. Like if you did upload
something that didn't meet those standards, they would kick you out. And so, you know, because of that I had some I
fashioned myself very knowledgeable about video and coding. But other than that, and like the infrastructure side of
things, I was pretty, pretty clueless. And so I show up in San Francisco, and I'm trying to do this job. And we, you
know, we had like, a meet up with the meetups in Athens were like glorified, it was just happy hours. It was like you'd
meet up and talk to like, the other 10 nerds in this kind of entrepreneurial ecosystem for an hour or two and then
leave. And so I show up in San Francisco and like, there are there is a meetup for everything. And it I you know, it's
like, it's like a starving person showing up and all you can eat buffet. I definitely overeat for a little while, like
pizza like six, six days a week, like because I'm showing up at a different meetup for anything there was like, you
could go to a meetup specific to like semicolons and JavaScript if you wanted to at the time. But there wasn't one for
video Uh, and so we we started the SF video tech meetup. And I got really lucky and that struck a bit of a nerve and
that like other other people in the ecosystem are excited about it. So we folks from YouTube and Twitch and Netflix and
CBS interactive and all these, like interesting people from these cool video companies showed up and liked it started
speaking and created the site, core core group. And then within a year or two, we we started a conference called
demuxed. And that was that was really pivotal, pivotal to my career. And then we decided that there like, there was more
to do still, like we gotten acquired right around the time that I joined encoders when we got acquired by Bray Cove.
Which embraco was, you know, great company to join. I love working with all of them. But they didn't, you know,
developers weren't there. Like, that's not the buyer. That's that's not where they're going. And we thought that there's
still unfinished business on the on the, to build interesting tools for developers. And as I alluded to, at the
beginning, like a sec, Stripe Twilio, like, just so floored, like going back all the way to like, why, why I enjoyed
programming so much to begin with. Like, these people were just these types of tools and have like that first wave of
like dev tools was, like, you know, like, how I mentioned having kind of my own my own brushes and his own canvas, and
suddenly like, these people, if it wasn't just brushes, they were handing you like, what's a better version of a brush?
Whatever, anyway, it was just like, suddenly, you're just like, wow, like, not only can I build whatever I want, like,
now I can build whatever I want. Like, I don't have to go figure out how to like build a payment gateway, I can just
make an API call to this company and do it. I don't have to go figure out how to like send a text message through
telecoms, I can just make an API request to Twilio and handle it. And like, I don't have to figure out how to like, go
deploy this somewhere. Heroku can do it for me, like there are all of these like, like that dev tool. First dev tool
cohort was like, mind blowing to me, in the sense of you, like before, I was like, Oh, you do anything? And I was like,
No, you really can do anything, like holy. This is so cool. That like, I can glue together a few of these systems and
build like, stuff I could have only dreamed of. But that same like, you know, we felt like that same thing didn't exist
for for video, like you know, the stripe for payments, the Twilio for telephony. That same kind of abstraction layer
wasn't there. So especially coming out of meetups and the conference all that sort of stuff. That's what we when we left
and joined together and started Starbucks, which is where I am now

</p><p><b>Tim Bourguignon 38:09</b></br>
that that isn't impressive how old things are connecting somehow. I mean, it's kind of always the same when you look
back and see where the dominoes failed and then rewrite the story but but it really makes sense however seeing took its
place and at some point culminated to two marks nowadays. That's yeah,

</p><p><b>Matthew McClure 38:29</b></br>
it is you know, I it's funny it's yeah, I hadn't in some of these hadn't tied all of these things together really until
kind of thinking through this it's not quite as straight of a line is like it feels like but it's the line certainly
exists between between you know, 12 year old me making dumb T shirts and and Max today.

</p><p><b>Tim Bourguignon 38:55</b></br>
So what's the what's the the core value add former for Max nowadays? And have you reached it already?

</p><p><b>Matthew McClure 39:06</b></br>
You know, I actually think so when we first started the company in like 20 I think very, very in 2015 very beginning of
2016 we had this thought of like we're gonna do all things video. Like, when you when you say like, not to harp on
stripe, I think Stripe actually does a really excellent job of this and the sense of like, at least for me, if I'm gonna
if I'm doing anything that touches money in any way, I'm going to check stripes Doc's first and see if they can just do
it for me. I'm familiar their API works. I trust them. And so I'm always gonna check their Doc's first if I'm if I'm
doing something that's money, money or money adjacent. And so we want to do that for video. It's like, oh, I want to
add, I want to add video, some into my app. And like right now you have to know so many different like video is such a
complicated topic. With so much nuance so many ways down the stack. That is Like, okay well kind of of your time we
don't live or On Demand or these days real time or like all the you have to know about transcoding and bitrate ladder
like even video now has gotten so much more complicated than it was in 2010. Because at that time it was just like, oh,
you need three different video types for the different browsers. But it was just like, Okay, you need to transcode your
video into like, Hu six, four and ogg. And you're fine. But these days, it's like, yeah, okay, all the browser's kind of
support one codec. That's the least of your concerns now. So now it's like, okay, but now I need like, adaptive bitrate
streaming, which is like, not just three different roads. Now we need like eight versions of every video so that I can
deliver to people at different so the yeah, whatever. Anyway, not to get too in the weeds of the video specifics. But
somehow video got way more complicated. It's gotten better for the for the end user. But it's gotten so much more
complicated as developer working with it. And so we wanted to be able to say like, okay, you don't, don't think don't
think and sense in the sense of in terms of transcoding and bitrate ladders and delivery and all these other things. But
it's interesting video, like, I want to add, like, I guess Similarly, a stripe like think instead of just, you think
payments, think video. And I think we're finally there. I think there's an interesting shift. I think people used to
think about like, real time as a very different type of video, like, it kind of wasn't thought about as video for years,
there's like, live and on demand. And then like, real time is a very specific thing that you would talk about otherwise.
And then I would honestly chalk it up to, at some point during the pandemic, like, real time, like people, when people
say like, oh, I'm working, I want to add video to my app. It could literally mean any kind of video, real time on demand
live, and the lines between them, especially if you're somebody that doesn't come from the ecosystem have learned so
much. And now we do all support three. And so I think actually, we're finally to that dream that we had in 2016. To be
able to say, like, I want to do something video. Let me go check them off stocks. They can probably help and like,
that's like, yeah, it's it's mostly true and broad strokes, which is really fun.

</p><p><b>Tim Bourguignon 42:17</b></br>
That is cool. That's very cool. When we go to advice that I always use is is, is to go back to one piece of your story
and ask you for advice. And for you, I cannot use that because I know which one is going to come. So I'm going to twist
a little bit and say well, when you finally found your your your mojo back when you finally found, okay, this advice of
not doing your hobby or not transforming your hobby as your day work was crap, or at least in your case was not a good
idea. And he finally said, Okay, now let's go in there. What were the forming advice that you got from from people
around you that really helped you embrace this and run with it?

</p><p><b>Matthew McClure 43:03</b></br>
So when I, when I did find, like when I find when I found my way back to tech as a yes. As a as a as a career after
college. Yeah. After college or during college, because this was during college that I like worked at that consultancy,
or what would be the advice? What was the advice that people gave around me that that led me to embracing it?

</p><p><b>Tim Bourguignon 43:28</b></br>
Or helped you embrace it even more? Because I think you were embracing it. Alright.

</p><p><b>Matthew McClure 43:36</b></br>
There's actually a funny, I'm not sure this totally answers your question. But it's a, it's another, it's another
pivotal moment that like, God, I don't know what my life would look like without this. So working for that AV company
and the startup has kind of happened at the same time, like, startup obviously wasn't paying. So it was like working, it
was basically working two full time jobs, I'd go to the go to this job at the AV company, and then go from there to the
incubator, and work until I effectively passed out and then go home and that's what I did every day. So still in Athens.
And one of my roommates in college, and really good friends had moved to was moved to San Francisco for a job. And he
was like, you really need to be here. This is like, this is your nerd home. You should you should be you should be here.
You'd love it here. And I was like Oh yeah, that sounds that sounds great. He's like no really you should you should
move out here I was like, Okay, I'll yeah, I'll move out there and he was like, Okay, we're gonna try to find a three
bedrooms so he had moved he was like looking for something with his with his with our other friend. Or I didn't know it
was his friend, but like I knew him adjacent. Anyway, And so at the time, they were living in an extended stay hotel
together in San Francisco, and then like going and leaving every day to like go do their apartment search. And the
market was crazy, it was really difficult to find a place to begin with even harder when you're like, two kids fresh to
two guys fresh out of college that have this mysterious third roommate that the landlord can't see. And so it's like, I
think they were just getting their butts kicked every time they're like, Okay, do I accept like, the family of three
that wants this three bedroom? Or do I accept these two, you know, early 20 Somethings the landlord, you know, and
honestly, in their, in the landlord's defenses, that's a pretty easy decision. And so every time they would call me keep
in mind rent in Athens and Atlanta, I was like, kind of living between the two at the time was dirt cheap. I think I was
paying 300 bucks a month for my for my bedroom, and like a two bedroom house in Atlanta, like, and I was commuting a few
days a week to Athens. Which admittedly was a really great deal even at the time. So every every week, I would get a
different call from my friend being like, okay, rents actually going to be this much. It'd be like a few $100 more. It's
like asking me this question is like, kind of getting increasingly nervous because I hadn't didn't get my job in San
Francisco yet. And I remember he finally he finally called me he's like, Okay, we found the place we signed the lease is
this much. And I just remember being like, I think it was like, it was like 1300 bucks. So like, a bedroom. And I was
like, That is not going to work for me. Like, oh my gosh, like I was incomprehensible. And I was like, I can't do it
man, like, find another roommate. And also gotten a full time offer for the AV company. He was a very clever, he's a
very, he's very clever. And so he had asked me if I wanted a full time job, I'd said no, he had given me the offer
anyway, and then like, just started paying me the money. Which is honestly, like, at the time, I was like, why would he
do that? And like, but it was very clever. Because then suddenly, I was just like, You know what, I got a pretty good
like, I could move back to Athens full time. The pay, especially for an area like Athens, I would be very comfortable.
It's this is fine, like so it's like very easy just to be like, You know what? I'm good. And my friend was just like,
no, like, Screw you. You're not, he's like, You need to be out here. We're getting this place, and we're not getting a
roommate, it's you, and you're just going to owe me the money for rent. Until you move out here. I'm gonna pay the rent,
and you're just gonna owe me whatever until you move out here. And like, in reality, I should have been like, no, like,
I don't know you like, but it worked. And so I was like, okay, and around the time when I had swiped right on Zencoder.
Anyway, I really do think if he hadn't, if he hadn't played hardball, there has been like, no, like, you should move out
here. And he forced me to and I think that I don't know if that's advice or just bullying. But it, it worked. And it was
like a really pivotal moment in my career. Because I went from, I don't know, staying comfortable and doing doing what
has comfortable and just like doing like, you know, somewhat interesting things. I don't know it, it opened my world up.
And suddenly I was I was working with with, well, I kept working with relationship coworkers, because I kept her that
and but like, suddenly, it's like, we had been kind of the tech guys at that company, the people. And so suddenly I'm
like, everybody at this company is our great engineers. It was a company full of people that were pretty senior. And so
like, I'm the one like junior developer there and like, yeah, it was it was this transformative moment. And it totally
started by my friend kind of being a jerk, and believe me to come out here. I was in his wedding. I said his wedding a
couple of weeks ago, and I was like, You're right. He was a guy now.

</p><p><b>Tim Bourguignon 49:11</b></br>
Let's see the the upside. This was a friend being a friend.

</p><p><b>Matthew McClure 49:15</b></br>
That was a friend being a friend. It really was.

</p><p><b>Tim Bourguignon 49:19</b></br>
Oh, that's nice. And that's certainly answer the the advice. The advice piece, friends being friends. You should listen
to them.

</p><p><b>Matthew McClure 49:26</b></br>
Yeah, yeah. Friends being friends. I think. Yeah, there's a piece of like, well now anyway.

</p><p><b>Tim Bourguignon 49:37</b></br>
I have a feeling we could talk more and longer and even longer and we haven't scratched the beginning of what your
stories but that's the info timebox Matt, it's been a fantastic ride, seeing where you've been at how you fought against
this career and finally embraced it and moved to San Francisco thanks to this friend and and the rest of history it
would say thank you very much for telling us this

</p><p><b>Matthew McClure 50:00</b></br>
Yeah, thanks for. Yeah, thanks for pulling that out. That was well, that was

</p><p><b>Tim Bourguignon 50:07</b></br>
the best place to go to continue the discussion with you. Ah, yeah. The meetup probably

</p><p><b>Matthew McClure 50:14</b></br>
probably the meetup. Yeah. SF video tech meetup SF. SF video.org. We try to livestream them. But being in person is
awesome person is going to be, yeah, they're there last Thursday of every month. And then demuxed. The conference, it's
going to be mid October, we don't have the we don't have firm dates yet. By the time hopefully by the time this is live,
we'll we'll have the CFP open and dates to check that out. So that's demuxed.com This year will be 2020
three.dymocks.com. Very, very original. You can find me on Twitter at Matt underscore McCullough. Or if you open the
chat box on max.com. Like it'll, it's pretty easy. It'll eventually find its way to me.

</p><p><b>Tim Bourguignon 51:00</b></br>
Also, anything else so you want to plug in time do not

</p><p><b>Matthew McClure 51:05</b></br>
know I mean, if you're if you ever think about doing some of the video trout mocks, we released a player that's pretty
fun. It uses web components and all sorts of fun new technology just released real time. Hopefully by the time this
comes out all those like old hat and super like, you know, everybody's like, Oh, yeah, much real time who doesn't use
it? But yeah, go yeah, go check it out. And I'm curious if anybody like, you know, the promise, the goal there is, if
you're just something video, come check us out. And if if anybody checks it out this listen to this, and that wasn't
their experience paying me mad@mcse.com. And I'd love to hear about why.

</p><p><b>Tim Bourguignon 51:44</b></br>
People, let's do it. And if you missed any of the links, scroll down. There'll be in the show notes. Matt, it's been
fantastic. Thank you for the ride.
