    Life is not easy for anyone. But when you have a drive and a passion for what you want to make or what he wants to do, you can reach places you never thought you will reach at first. So please know that from the beginning, I always have I owe I have always enjoyed sharing my knowledge. So as much as it was a tiny I knowledge, I share it. So here's the tip for everyone here. The best way to help others is sharing knowledge. That was very important for me.

Though, as you know the show exists to help listeners understand what your story look like and imagine how to shape their own future. So as is usual on the show, let's go back to your beginnings. Where would you place to start of your dev journey,
    
   </p><p><b> Glaucia Lemos  2:26</b><br/>  
    but you mean my passion for technology?
    
   </p><p><b> Tim Bourguignon  2:30</b><br/>  
    Absolutely. Let's start there. Okay,
    
   </p><p><b> Glaucia Lemos  2:32</b><br/>  
    so I have a huge story to tell because there's a lot of things happened to me in the past before to go to the technologies. So in the mid 2002 I was in my high school called College estado obrigado short is public school here in Brazil. So one of the things I enjoyed most of after my classes was that they usually took place in the morning and often in the afternoon I went to the computer lab. So I already had our basic computer course the famous you know, windows, Excel, PowerPoint and Word courses. And I've always had the curiosity to learn new things. So the the Director of the School Public School not it's me, not it's not it's there's my aptitude and passion for computers. So with that, she asked me to enter another student to be among monitors to make a kind of Word Excel and PowerPoint courses to the community. So of course I accepted right away so I decided to do the windows and word courses to the local community. And however as soon as the computer mentorships were over, and other students and I used to the time to use the internet, which added the time was used to dial up connection or to play a little game called Carmi Santiago using the floppy desktop I don't know how to say this in English and during the game I wondered myself how works what is what is hooking the behind the scenes this game so in short the game and the questions surround me a motivated me to want to continue the work about the the technology so late that afternoon. I had I think around 215 years old, I said to myself, well, this is what I want to work with. And we'll fighting for it. So the that's exactly the what I'm doing right now.
    
   </p><p><b> Tim Bourguignon  4:56</b><br/>  
    Wow. So you can really pinpoint in time At that time where you had this game and wondered, what's happening, how was it making this and and that was it. Cool.
    
   </p><p><b> Glaucia Lemos  5:08</b><br/>  
    Yeah. Because before our like to be architecture or a biological see see my biological person because I really love to see and practice a kind of snorkeling thing because I really enjoy to recording and dive in the sea. But after to play this game kind of my mind is starting to blowing up now this is that I want to do when I went when I really grow up, you know so and look at me I started our local community in helping other persons and look at me right now working with the community in the large in the the most largest company in the world is the same job but I'm paying for my club pay me to do the same as I did in the public school. So it's very interesting thing. What life's plan for us what, what do you need to do during your life? You know? So it's very interesting.
    
   </p><p><b> Tim Bourguignon  6:19</b><br/>  
    It is indeed and when you look back and see where the dominoes fell and where where you got that skill and where you got that opportunity. And when you got that, and you see the past. It's always interesting to see you there afterwards. The way you describe it. I figured okay, now you would be doing game programming in a studio somewhere. No, something happened along the way.
    
   </p><p><b> Glaucia Lemos  6:39</b><br/>  
    Yeah, sure. Sure. Sure. However, getting to the first opportunity, the technology area was a long journey. So from 2004 to 2006. I work door to door selling dairies, diaries, precisely to help my father and mom, because it was a pretty dark period. In my family because my father had been unemployed for months and was unable to bring food, there was the need to do this type of the job during 2007 to 2013. I worked with different places before two technologies such as for example, selling insurance adjuster TV for financial assistance was even a foreign foreign exchange a travel agent. So everything before joining, joining an opportunity in technology. So even his last opportunity as a travel agent, earlier was where I had a salary upgrade. And I was finally able to pay for the primary technology college that I started around 2011 to 2013 is an anniversary college here. So in this period at this time, fourth are boosted my decision to keep to continue my dream to work with the technology. So I started the college in February 2011. In that I remember like today because in the class 1103 There were more than 60 persons in the class, a lot of people because the class the room that they was very overcrowded or there weren't even so many people interesting take their course. So it's very interesting to remember that. So however as the years went by, the number starting to kept, keep dropping. So in the middle in December 2013 I finished my I finished the college, I was the first person in my family to earn a university degree. So maybe all of you are asking yourself right now but Glosser how many people completed the course with you that time so well these before the graduation party and to receive my diploma, I received a call from the college director saying that I will be the person who will represent that year's graduating class in the in the very that I graduated. I confess that I was very, very, I was very afraid about it and extremely surprised by the invitation. So just a second because I organize some ideas before. So when I arrived at a graduation event, to my surprise, there were only three graduated persons and I was the only female person. So just to give you an idea In the beginning, it was a most 60 persons in the class. And only three, only three maybe made it to the end. So at that moment, I understood why I was choosing to give my classes graduation speech. So it's really sad to see this kind of circumstances happening. But especially for being the only female person at the time, just a second. So during my graduation speech, I mentioned the Steve Jobs the call I quoted Steve Jobs phrase, at the end of my speech that says a lot for all developer persons here is hearing this podcast Stay hungry, stay foolish. So in fact, we need to have a daily eagerness to want to learn new things all the time in our field. So if we ever learned something, may we always be humble in sharing this knowledge with others. So this is something that I that I keep with myself until today, keep keep, keep my humble as a humble person. Humble Meza humble, I think, and especially sharing the knowledge to other persons, because you can change their lives in different ways, you know, so this is was my context, but it it was very difficult times, because every day, especially during that speech, a lot of things CAMI came through my head, for example, working up early everyday to work around six, six and half em go into the, to the to the station, train in Rio, take the crowded train arriving POC totally at work at 9am. And then leave my job at five and a half a pm in my job and take the bus, very crowded to the university, and then studying to 10pm and then arriving at home at 11pm and then start a new day. So all this having to work on my own to be able to pay for the college because unfortunately, my parents didn't have the financial means. So it was exhausting for sure. I won't lie now. So for it was three years of great a harness and forth so but in the end, it was so worth it. So this is the the recommendation that I would like to save to everyone here. Everything in our lives is not easy. So it's always very hard. But you never you never you never give up about your dream. What do you want to do your life especially? So this is my advice about it.
    
   </p><p><b> Tim Bourguignon  13:54</b><br/>  
    would ever want one question there? Okay. This has been a dream for you for for many, many years. At that point, when when you finally finish this degree, did you have the feeling that you had learned exactly what you what you envision you will be learning? Did you have the feeling that you arrived at the place you wanted to be in? Obviously, it was a good place? But was it the one you had envisioned?
    
   </p><p><b> Glaucia Lemos  14:16</b><br/>  
    You made during the in the high school or after to finish my graduation?
    
   </p><p><b> Tim Bourguignon  14:22</b><br/>  
    At the end of your graduation? Have you have your Yes,
    
   </p><p><b> Glaucia Lemos  14:25</b><br/>  
    yes, sure. Sure. Sure. For sure. Even I still have my story to tell. It's very interesting to tell. Let me share for you here. So when I finished the college, I was still working with a travel agent. So yeah, that's when a client appeared who was very interested in traveling to Buenos itis to buy some dollars. And I gave her a lot of tips about some places and restaurants that she could have visited because in that same year I visited Before buenos itis on vacation that same year. So during the conversation, I realized the woman was wearing a tech company uniform. So edit the end of the tips that I gave to her about the Buenos IDCT. I asked her if she worked for the only pharma company IT company, you know, so she said, Yes, gloves. I work in this tech company. So it was my cue. I spoke to her. Okay, last week, I finished my college graduate, it was my college graduation. I recently completed an advancement C sharp course. So do you have any roles open the role of positions of their or internship or for as a developer junior person. And eternally, she said, Glauser, you were talking to the right person, because we just opened our new role or position as a junior developer in C Sharp in our company. And I am the HR person to hiring the right hiring sector. So leave your resume with me. And I will schedule their interview for you as soon as possible when they return from my tip. So I don't need to tell what happened. So I did the interview. And 10 days later, I was left my agents travel, a travel agent job. And I started my, my job as a junior developer, working with C sharp, so I was very happy that occasion. So it was very interesting to tell this because everything in our lives changed a lot. But when you want to pursue your dream, you do whatever you want, in the correct way of cars to achieve your dreams. So he was very interesting to tell this,
    
   </p><p><b> Tim Bourguignon  16:56</b><br/>  
    that that's a nice story, indeed. And I'll talk about how do you call that not an accident on in a good way coincidence, that about the coincidence, I'm pretty sure you were selfless at the beginning giving this tips and slowly realizing oh, but there's a question there to be asked. And if nothing had come out of it, then well, you would have given good tips. But sometimes it really serves you right to be to be selfless, and and, and be helpful to other people and then never know what's coming, what's going to come back.
    
   </p><p><b> Glaucia Lemos  17:24</b><br/>  
    Yeah, that's why I always said in my talk presentations, that the hard skills very important to us as a developer, but mostly all the time. The most important thing important thing is the heart the soft skills, especially in the communication, the networking, because if you want to achieve any good job today, probably someone will referring you in this job. So probably take these kinds of advice to get a good conversation with other persons. And then some a presidential Mira meetups or even you know, events or conferences, it's very important to spread out your rotations to work wherever you want to wherever you want to. So that's why I really enjoyed to know new persons to try to learn new languages, because this is a useful way to make a new relationship. Partnership is based in in trust. So that's why I really enjoyed to even be in the tech area, I really enjoyed to be a very empathy person to talk with the different persons in cultures because this is a good way to open your doors to other in different places that you that are probably in the near future, maybe even new work in the best company probably in the near future, you need to change your job or you need to make a new decision in your life. So this way, you can let your doors open all the soul. This is my my advice for all of you here hearing this podcast right now. And I'm not being
    
   </p><p><b> Tim Bourguignon  19:03</b><br/>  
    heavily agree, or poorly as a as a host of this podcast, I've had so many connections with people that we probably would never see again, most of them but but still, it's it's connecting with people is discovering new things. It's it's being put in a place where where you learn things you didn't know you didn't know. And this is fascinating in its in its own way. So yeah, do it, do it people. So that was the start of your story. What happened in this company and what did you learn there and how did you travel to the next company news story?
    
   </p><p><b> Glaucia Lemos  19:40</b><br/>  
    So I worked in this company for one year working with as class CASP. ASP Okay, ASP classical. I don't know how to spell in English. ASP. ASP. ASP. ASP. Classic ASP. So And because as was a junior position, so they gave me a little task is to deal it, especially bootstrap thing. In that occasion, we was using jQuery. So I had a lot of task is using jQuery, but just stay it at this company for one year from December 2013 to December 2014. Because I resigned that company because I had another dream to work with technology and other countries. So I decided to to I choose the country was Argentina. So in February 2015, I moved to Buenos itis to get an opportunity technology. And at the same time to volunteer work in the Chinese community. Because of that occasion, I was studying Chinese Mandarin Chinese for nine years to order to carry out these volunteer work that already performed here in Brazil. So in May in 2015, after getting my server located in necessary local documentation, especially in Yergin, Tina, to work as a blank person specifically wanted to tell as a blanket person, I got my first opportunity in one of the biggest technology multinationals in Argentina called I don't know if I can say the names here.
    
   </p><p><b> Tim Bourguignon  21:26</b><br/>  
    But it doesn't hurt me.
    
   </p><p><b> Glaucia Lemos  21:30</b><br/>  
    Okay, the company was global or HC global logic, a Latin and experience that was one of the best ever have ever had. Because my first experience in it was working as at work work waterfall flow at this new company, Argentina, everything related with a jail so and all the conflict or all the conflict that I found of there the barrier of the language. So also I was leaving Argentina, I speak Portuguese, and they're in Argentina, the people speak speaks Spanish so actually was not a kind of a huge Berea as I was already taking Spanish classes with my best friend, Daniela Metatron. Him and being the full time contract in this company probably will be will be was a good opportunity to to, to practice my Spanish. So I was look allocated to a project that I needed a person who knew the business rules regarding insurance, something that in the past I had already worked with before and some knowledge with C sharp, something that I had for in the last company. So look again, the other lightning, yeah. So the project started in May, and to go since 2015. And it was when they finished the first project that I received a new challenge or to learn a new stack called Node js to help them to do a kind of a migration project that was in Java to Node js. So in that occasion, never, I never heard before about not Node js. But in the way I accepted the challenge. And I started to study intensively Node js so in some what very, I'm very methodical person. So when I started to when starting to learn a new, like a new technology or new programming language, I like to share what I'm learning. So that's why I do have a YouTube channel since it goes 2013 And I have a lot of blog posts as well WordPress. So when I decided to learn No, Jas to make this migration project to Java to chill Node js, I decided to share my knowledge in my studies around to no GS. And I decided to return to Brazil in 2015 because for political for politicians, politicians, situations circumstances of their energy Tina because the the culture the cultural was very expensive to stay up there. So I decided to return to Brazil. And when I returned to Brazil, someone in Microsoft specially person called who is vulnerable survivor for another survivor. She is the main person responsible for con to contact The global MVP program, the Microsoft develop the Microsoft developer of the, the Microsoft most valued was well, professional Yes, program. So as soon as I returned to Brazil, so for another surprise survivor noticed that I was constantly writing about Node js. So she contacted me these was I think, in March and April, in 2016, I think she really liked my content. So because that occasion was writing about no Gs, and even recording videos about No, Jas, she asked asked me to if I would like to be part of the MVP program. And she started to, to help me, mentoring me to get insight into the to the program. And six months later, I was joining to the MVP program, I think your work was this. Sorry, she could connect with me in 2016, October, and six, six months later, into 2017. In April, I was joining to the MVP program. So since then, this is one of my first steps with the local community, especially here in Brazil. So look, again, helping other persons to again a new steps in signing the technology because sometimes we want to jump all in coding, coding, coding stuff, coding, or reporting a bug your Nisha, but when you decided to share your knowledge, what are you learning about it? A sharing your knowledge to other persons probably can pay attention to other persons about your job about it. Because this is a useful way to show to the community that you like to help other persons especially so if you want to be noticed, especially to to the HR or even to the I don't know maybe to the a huge company probably starting to write a blog post or creating videos, technical videos, sharing the knowledge. Probably could be a first step for everyone here.
    
   </p><p><b> Tim Bourguignon  27:28</b><br/>  
    Indeed, indeed, you were you were creating some some content about no GS for for C sharp developers, or why Why does Microsoft take interest into you? No, GS is not a Microsoft technology.
    
   </p><p><b> Glaucia Lemos  27:40</b><br/>  
    Because in that moment, in that occasion for another survivor was taking care of the the Microsoft MVP program here in Brazil. In their case, she noticed we don't have too much informations, how to use JavaScript in server side with Azure services, and a few persons talking about so that's why she noticed, look, I think this girl could be a good person to this program because she can critical things about Node js, related with some Azure services. So that's why she mentor mentor me that occasion to be in the the MVP program.
    
   </p><p><b> Tim Bourguignon  28:23</b><br/>  
    I see I see around the timeframes, you say 2016 2017, I received
    
   </p><p><b> Glaucia Lemos  28:28</b><br/>  
    the warning. The word that the word. I was worded in April 1. When I received when I received the email was thinking what? What the hell because it looks like today's April 1, I had to call to her that occasion, though it's true. You are in the program. Okay. Awesome.
    
   </p><p><b> Tim Bourguignon  28:55</b><br/>  
    Nice. Around that timeframe, I also met a met a woman who was working for Microsoft, she just she was just hired at that time as an iOS developer with exactly the same the same logic saying, well, your iOS application has to interact with some cloud some kind of cloud services. And so she was hired to be the face of Azure on iOS. And I had the same discussion with with her back then say why Microsoft has no interest in ours. But yes, they do.
    
   </p><p><b> Glaucia Lemos  29:29</b><br/>  
    Just just to give you the for example, right now, I'm working here, probably you you'll be you're starting to talk about my my actual job right now here at Microsoft, as a client advocate. Here. We do have a huge organization called developer relations team, and it is organization with you have, I think, almost 1000 persons. For example, we do have content writers, engineers, cloud advocates in different areas. For example, we do have cloud advocates in pipe Some Java JavaScript, TypeScript, me 365, Java, verse Golang. So many, many different languages are different stacks, for example, even we infrastructure as code as well. We do have, for example, April Edwards, she is from England. And she talks about a lot Azure DevOps or infrastructure. So we do have many are agnostic, usually, as advocates, we usually pretend tends to talk about agnostic languages, especially Python, colon roast, or even JavaScript, because this is a different community, because usually, when you think about Microsoft, the first programming language kames out to any developer is C sharp. So that's why we strive to demystifying this kind of mindset from the developers, especially the agnostic who wants that Microsoft embrace of the languages of the technologies, even the open source ones or not, or not even open source languages or technologies. So that's why look in 2016 2017 Microsoft is starting to think you look Glauser to be a good person to be part of this program. Look how long how long times ago about it to think about it about to embrace the JavaScript community inside the Microsoft solely he was very special moment because when they get insight into the program, I started to received a lot of call for papers. So make some presentations. For example, my my first talk presentation was in 2017 about TypeScript. So also you are in the program opening a lot of cute good doors for us so I highly recommend all of you here especially because we do have two different programs here a mike and Microsoft for example. We do have the MVP program for pro developments and other one for students and I don't know if everybody heard Timothy, the Microsoft ambassadors learning master's program here okay. So if you are a student so reach reach me out after to this podcast because probably I can direct you to the right persons to be part of this program. So this students program so to be part of these programs is very important as well as a developer or even not even not being a developer because we do have different technologies he started the program for example, we do have MVPs and Power BI data machine learning and different in technologies area so probably if you want to reach out or following your your your dream to be part of the technology working with technology independently if you want to be a developer data saying data scientist person so try to reach me to try to understand a little bit more about the the MVP program or even the Microsoft is students learning ambassadors so probably to be a good first step for you as well.
    
   </p><p><b> Tim Bourguignon  33:28</b><br/>  
    Absolutely, and I want to link that to what you said before it's all about people and and do use programs and specially the student one is the best way to get a fast track linking to many many many very influential people can give you ideas on where to go right and left and then it is a fast track program really
    
   </p><p><b> Glaucia Lemos  33:46</b><br/>  
    Yeah. Because you can work in different in different spheres for example, you can learn a new technologies because you will receive new any day informations from the product teams from the MVP program or even the msla program as well. And you can make a good connections with internally specially the product teams from from the Microsoft Teams, product teams, and especially with the community because you can learn how to do to see which the needs from the community for example, another day I did a kind of a poll asking to the especially to the Brazilian community here, what do they want to learn during the 2022 so this is the thing that you that you learn day by day being incited together with the community so probably could be a good way to learn first and listen to the community the nice from the humidity so probably probably know for sure is a good opportunity to be in these programs for sure.
    
   </p><p><b> Tim Bourguignon  34:58</b><br/>  
    And one thing I want to highlight as well as the Add under the image of Microsoft or I owe that there at Microsoft has changed over the years. It used to be very much in 20 2015 2016, Microsoft preaching the good, the good and the good things to do. And it it turned around a lot with a developer advocates or clouds. Oh, yeah. developer advocates being the voice of the community and bringing back what is being said, in the community inside Microsoft. And so are all the advocates are a met are really a demand of saying, Well, I've heard this, I've done this, talking to the product team and say, well, you should go in this direction. I think that's why we have products like like Visual Studio code, for instance, which is absolutely not Microsoft centric. And one of the the most used IDs nowadays. So that's Did you did you envision him to to go in a different direction? Did you envision that you would be going so much into communities in this tech journey of yours?
    
   </p><p><b> Glaucia Lemos  35:53</b><br/>  
    No, because before to accept this job here at Microsoft, I received opportunity to work in Adelaide in Australia as a as a software developer in a FinTech company. Okay, so when I received this invitation to be accorded advocate here in Brazil, specially by right now, I'm global advocate. So I talked to myself look, is a great opportunity. And the, because even during my occasion that I was in the, in the college, I was there a person, the students that are was organizing a some events in the college, especially in connecting with Microsoft employees. So it was always my dream to work here at Microsoft. So while I received this invitation, so why not so I did in the process, the four phases for interviews, different interviews, and I decided to get in here as a cloud advocate, but I never ever think before about it. And wow, I will be pay to be to be a car advocate or working with the community. But sometimes I feel that I want to dirty my hands in the cold because not not that this job, I I cannot do a lot of coding stuff. But when when I say dirty my hands with coding stuff, I want to say that I want to put some recording in production. Because when you are a crowded advocate, usually you have to create some content in level 100 Or level 200 For beginners, or just to teach or just to teach some few part of how to use for example, Azure functions with JavaScript or even Azure static web apps with I don't know maybe Azure Seco just latest part of the project now the the whole picture the big picture, in some project, you know, so but I, I never thought before, there are I will be paid to work with community. So it's a very interesting thing.
    
   </p><p><b> Tim Bourguignon  38:27</b><br/>  
    So the Do you have a whole bunch of pet projects or hobby projects to put code into production? Or do you have a side gig that you're doing on nights and weekends? So how do you
    
   </p><p><b> Glaucia Lemos  38:38</b><br/>  
    know raise your hands early? Yeah, right right now I decided to help during my free time here to help an all G G in your company or an NGO NGO to help them for free because I can receive it so this is a good way to to return my my developer thing you know about it is how to port it some recording production. This stuff you know in it during the weekend, sometimes not all the all the weekends because we need to rest or just only rest in our pajamas only watching some Netflix movie, but sometimes I watch some IUD my cursors or anything new for example. Right now I'm studying a lot Graph QL with TypeScript with Docker so because it's my irritation journey to the this 2022 year so yes sometimes yes but sometimes I feel that I wonder like to be more prisons with coding stuff but but I know that I can do this during my free time that I'm doing right now. Is D in your organization.
    
   </p><p><b> Tim Bourguignon  39:53</b><br/>  
    I guess it comes and goes there's some phases in your life where where you get to to do this and some We have to focus new work, they work and there isn't that much place for that. It's okay. I'm not so worried anymore. I used to be I remember I used to be I used to work nights and weekends really to, to hone my skills and continue exploring stuff, etc. And at some point, you realize there's some phases. And that's it. So you seem to have found a very nice place for yourself at Microsoft, where you want it to be without necessarily knowing it in the first place. So So do you see yourself staying there for happily ever after? Where do you where do you see yourself going in the future?
    
   </p><p><b> Glaucia Lemos  40:33</b><br/>  
    This is a hard question. Because every six months, we have to do a Kira reconnects, and is a kind of evaluation, to see how was ours work in the last six months. And always at the end of this connects, they always ask as to us, why do you want to be in the next five years. So right now, after to be here most most are going to four years, because I completed three years in March, I can see that I can following two different paths here at Microsoft. So for example, I can be keep as a software developer engineer, as a principal, or I can go into the program manager for some product, for example. So I started to talk with different persons in different areas, here at Microsoft about it. And I, personally, I decided to be in the near future, I don't know, being probably a Program Manager for some as your product, for example. So probably my path here. Could be Oh, it could be maybe a Program Manager for some measure production, you know, so I don't know. So I do have our managers so she have to manage me.
    
   </p><p><b> Tim Bourguignon  42:01</b><br/>  
    On she worried to, to leave the community a little bit behind. And as a as a program injury, we'd have to focus really on the domain and less.
    
   </p><p><b> Glaucia Lemos  42:11</b><br/>  
    For example, Jeff Fritz, Jeffrey, do you know him? Jeff? No, Jeff Fritz, the person who do live coding about dotnet, C sharp, Jeff, Jeff Fritz never heard about him. For example, Jeff Fritz is a person, he do a lot of live coding every day. I think most everyday I think about C sharp or dotnet documentations. He's a program manager. So he's, you're working with the community. So not exactly when you decided to be a program manager that you ran out, we will not work anymore with the community. But even more you have to work with the community because as a, for example, imagining yourself Timothy that you are working as Azure data as your SQL program manager. So to realize which kind of the new features you want to to these new to this product, what is the best way to collect feedbacks in the community. So probably you have two different approaches as advocate, because you have to think as a product, specifically, product, not a present, for example, right now I have to work with a different product with a specifically language, for example, in my case, JavaScript with different Azure services. But also you decide to work here on Microsoft, specifically product, you have to see what is the end to end experience to work with, with this product, how to find a new feature for this product, how to find a bug or how to improve the the end to end experience. Really, with this product, so this is the main context about as a product as a program and manager for example. Simona cotton, I think probably you can already hear about her. She was she was in the past accorded advocate a the past. He my team. She was my leader before, right. Okay, actually, I really missed her a lot. She's a good person.
    
   </p><p><b> Tim Bourguignon  44:28</b><br/>  
    She's awesome. Yeah,
    
   </p><p><b> Glaucia Lemos  44:29</b><br/>  
    she's a very, very empathy. So she's a lovely person. And I miss I miss a lot her. So she was in the past a principal advocate. He has a the JavaScript team. Okay, and now she's a Principal Program Manager, very specifically product called Azure static web apps. So all the time she had to make some good connections with the different product teams with all the services with all the products from the Microsoft so For example, I think another day Simona was doing a kind of talk presentation about how to use Azure static web apps with a different service. I don't know. So isn't, but it's a different approach. But of course, you, you will be not too much in the community as advocate. But you still have to work with the community is a different approach, advocate versus program manager, you know,
    
   </p><p><b> Tim Bourguignon  45:31</b><br/>  
    yeah, I see, I'll do scan the work hand in hand, still being in the community, just not doing exactly the same thing, but still be in very, very deeply linked into the community. That is really cool. And we have reached the end of the show already. Has there been in your life? One advice that has really followed you that has been forming and one of the things you would like to give away or give away again, for the year, the next generation?
    
   </p><p><b> Glaucia Lemos  45:57</b><br/>  
    Yes, I do. And will be very large.
    
   </p><p><b> Tim Bourguignon  46:02</b><br/>  
    We don't have that much. Okay, good.
    
   </p><p><b> Glaucia Lemos  46:05</b><br/>  
    Okay, what I can say about this whole story that I tell here right now, so life is not easy for anyone. So but when you have a drive, and a passion for what you want to make, or what he wants to do, you can reach places you never thought you will reach at first. So please know that from the beginning, I always have I owe I have always enjoyed sharing my knowledge. So as much as it was a tiny I knowledge, I share it. So here's the tip for everyone here, the best way to help others is sharing knowledge. So that was very important for me, because specially when you birthdays are not other important factors that can help you, for example, meeting new people, because when you start sharing knowledge, you are helping other people in creating a relationship with them. So who in the near future can help you, for example, so see what happened to me at the first opportunity by giving a travel tips, I was able to create a relationship with a person, she helped me to get my first job as developer. And another tip is patient and be a humble person, because everything absolutely everything in our lives depends on these two words patience, and humility. So, start trading small goals. So, and as you achieve for example, you will be able to aim for other greater life plans, whether personal or even professional way. So but you always have to remember that regardless of the work you are doing, you will need to deal with the people. So the best way to deal with the people is to be a humble person. So and then also be a good listener as well. Another point that I always saw, always said from my father of the junior persons is be a persistence. Because for example, if during the college for example, when I was the only female graduating person, I could easily have given up for example, instead of being Warren Harrigan, in where I am right now, so you who are a woman as much as you are the minority right now. So which is a serious extreme bear in our society, Lake of more woman in STEM area, for example, in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics, maths, for example. So my advice here is never give up. Because Don't be swayed by comments like she can do it. Or she can, she can do this kind of the stats, because very difficult. So it's sad to hear this call, but don't give up. Always try to do your best. So try to show what you know, always being still humble, or humbly share. Because there will that for sure, there will always be someone that you may not even know who you notice you. And that same person can take you to the places you initially didn't even imagine. So never never so persistent. Always. So this is my, my my devices.
    
   </p><p><b> Tim Bourguignon  49:48</b><br/>  
    And this is awesome. I'm smiling over a big smile on my face. I agree to all it's just saying this is so important. I'm really glad you're you're underlining it again. Thank you so much for that. So So where would be the best place to contact you start a discussion with you and and connect with you on a human level as you've been advocating it during the whole show.
    
   </p><p><b> Glaucia Lemos  50:09</b><br/>  
    Sure, especially on Twitter, and LinkedIn, as well. So you can find me up there, even if you want to send me any direct message asking for any help, because for example, I think two weeks ago, I helped someone here in Brazil, who was Ober driver, and this person would like to be a developer person. So he was starting to starting to enter Technology University College. And he this person received the first opportunity to work as a developer, but he had to first to make the test. So I decided to take myself Saturday to do a pair programming with this person. And three days before of these pair programming, he received the, you know, the news. Glauser, thank you very much for your help. Right now. I'm starting my, my first job as a developer, I will left my Uber driver job right now. So probably, I can help you. But not all the time. But if you can use you, for sure, you can reach me all the time, especially on Twitter, LinkedIn, so you can find out there.
