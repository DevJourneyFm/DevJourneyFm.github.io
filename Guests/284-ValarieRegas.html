<div><h2>Highlights</h2>
    <p>
        Our latest podcast episode features an inspiring conversation with Valarie Regas, a woman who successfully transitioned from being a stay-at-home mom to a thriving DevOps engineer. Valarie's story is a testament to the power of perseverance and the value of diverse perspectives in the tech industry.
    </p><p>
        As we delve into Valarie's journey, it's impossible not to admire her passion for technology. From her early fascination with computers at a young age to her determination to enter the tech industry after years of domestic life, Valarie's path is nothing short of inspirational. Her unique experiences and perspective have brought invaluable insights to her teams and have made a significant impact on the industry.
    </p><p>
        One of the most important topics we discussed in this episode is the significance of mental health in the tech industry. Valarie advocates for more humane work cultures that prioritize employees' mental health. She bravely shares her personal experiences with burnout, depression, and anxiety, emphasizing the need for companies to consider the human aspect in their drive for innovation.
    </p><p>
        The episode also touches on the trials and tribulations of job hunting. It's a process that can often feel daunting, especially for those who feel like outsiders in the industry. But as Valarie explains, it's essential to value your unique background and experiences. She discusses the importance of diverse perspectives in problem-solving, reinforcing the need for inclusivity and diversity in the tech industry.
    </p><p>
        One interesting aspect of our conversation revolves around the influence of upbringing on leadership styles. As a Southern woman in tech, Valarie's experiences shed light on how her cultural background has shaped her approach to leadership. This perspective is invaluable in a tech world that often overlooks the importance of cultural diversity in leadership roles.
    </p><p>
        Towards the end of our conversation, we delve into the issue of parental leave policies in the U.S. Valarie gets real about her experience of returning to work after having a baby, highlighting the lack of support for new parents in many tech companies. It's a sobering reminder of the work that still needs to be done to ensure tech workplaces are supportive and inclusive for all employees.
