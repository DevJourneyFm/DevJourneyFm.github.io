<div><h2>Highlights</h2>
    <p>
        <h3>Navigating Interests and Learning Languages (2:15)</h3>
        The interview begins with Russ Miles reflecting on his early interests in mathematics and philosophy, highlighting the importance of curiosity and continuous learning. He remarks that learning a programming language is akin to learning a spoken language – it's about understanding and communicating ideas. As a junior developer, immersing yourself in different languages can broaden your perspective and enhance your problem-solving skills.
        <h3>The Art of Debugging (8:22)</h3>
        Russ shares his experiences at the Ministry of Defense, where he worked as a software engineer. He emphasizes the value of debugging and problem-solving, referring to it as an "art form". He advises junior developers to embrace debugging as a crucial aspect of their job, encouraging them to learn from their mistakes and continually improve.
        <h3>From Debugging to Creating Software (15:40)</h3>
        Moving on, Russ talks about his journey from being an engineer who fixes things to someone who builds software. He describes the significance of understanding the business needs and how it can directly influence the software you develop. He encourages developers to engage with stakeholders and users to better understand their needs.
        <h3>A Shift Towards Teaching (20:57)</h3>
        Russ shares his experience of transitioning to teaching, where he worked to equip other developers with the necessary skills. He emphasizes the importance of good communication in teaching, and how being a good teacher requires understanding others' perspectives.
        <h3>The Importance of Open Source Projects (28:00)</h3>
        Russ then delves into his involvement in open source projects. He talks about how such projects can be a great avenue for developers to learn and contribute. He stresses that participation in open source projects not only enhances coding skills but also provides a platform for collaboration and communication.
        <h3>Venturing into Chaos Engineering (33:50)</h3>
        Russ shares his introduction to chaos engineering, the practice of intentionally inducing failures in systems to ensure their resilience. He speaks of his work in Chaos Toolkit, an open-source chaos engineering project. Russ advises junior developers to start with the science and understand the hypothesis of chaos experiments.
        <h3>Fundraising for Startups (38:10)</h3>
        Russ goes on to recount his experience with Excel Venture Partners, highlighting the significance of patience and persistence when seeking funds for a startup. He underlines the importance of timing in fundraising and the need to understand investors' needs.
        <h3>From Chaos to Reliability (42:33)</h3>
        Towards the end, Russ talks about his current venture, Reliably, and how they aim to help developers embrace reliability. He highlights the challenges of reliability as compared to security, with the world acting as the "malign actor". He encourages developers to consider reliability as an integral part of their development process.
        <h3>Wrapping Up with Advice (46:14)</h3>
        Russ wraps up the interview with a piece of advice for those interested in chaos engineering - start with an experiment, understand the hypothesis and don't rush into production. He extends an invitation to reach out to him for guidance and insights, demonstrating his commitment to continuous learning and sharing knowledge.
