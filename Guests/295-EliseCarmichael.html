    <p>
        Elise Carmichael's career in technology is a testament to the power of curiosity and resilience. Her early fascination with technology began with a Commodore 64, sparking a lifelong passion that eventually led her to the role of CTO at Lakeside. In our podcast episode, Elise discusses how her interests in music and technology have played in concert to guide her career trajectory, offering a unique perspective on innovation and growth within the tech industry.
    </p><p>
        Her narrative begins with those formative years, where the intersection of her tech-savvy upbringing and the magic of early programming laid the groundwork for her future. She fondly recalls her mother's influence and the thrill of coding games from magazine templates, instilling a deep-seated love for creating and learning. This foundation would prove invaluable as Elise navigated the tech industry's ebbs and flows.
    </p><p>
        Elise's career path wasn't without its challenges. She candidly recounts her early exposure to management and the toxic environments she faced, particularly as a woman in a male-dominated field. However, instead of succumbing to these adversities, Elise harnessed them as fuel for growth. Her story is one of transformation, demonstrating the courage it takes to pivot when necessary—whether that meant briefly exploring a career in medicine or tackling new roles that pushed her out of her comfort zone.
    </p><p>
        Elise's transition from product strategy to becoming a public-facing figure post-merger is particularly enlightening. It reveals the layers of decision-making and the boldness required to step into the unknown, which are crucial in a landscape as dynamic as tech. Her insights into navigating these transitions provide a blueprint for professionals at any stage of their career.
    </p><p>
        The discussion rounds off with Elise highlighting her desire to continually learn and grow, be it through mergers and acquisitions or venturing into CEO roles or private equity. Her story reinforces the notion that placing oneself in challenging situations is often the most effective way to learn and evolve.
