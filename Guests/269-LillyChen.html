<div><h2>Highlights</h2>
    <p>
        <h3>Discovering the Joy of Programming (00:06)</h3>
        Lilly began her coding journey at age 8, discovering the world of programming through her father's work. **Start early**, even if it's just with small projects; it can ignite a lifelong passion.
        <h3>Importance of Internships (05:45)</h3>
        Lilly emphasized the value of internships in understanding the tech landscape and finding the right fit. Internships offer both exposure and experience. **Grasp every opportunity** you get, even if it’s in a domain slightly different from your core interest.
        <h3>From A Junior Dev to A CTO (10:27)</h3>
        Climbing the career ladder, Lilly transitioned from a junior developer to becoming a CEO at Contented. For those starting, understand that **every role teaches something new**. Embrace change and never be afraid to step into a larger role when the time comes.
        <h3>The Value of Mentorship (15:58)</h3>
        For Lilly, mentors like Monk and many other developers played crucial roles in her growth. **Seek mentors** in your journey; they can offer direction, advice, and a different perspective that can be instrumental to your growth.
        <h3>Adapting to Rapid Tech Changes (20:09)</h3>
        Technology, especially in software development, evolves rapidly. Lilly's experience teaches that it's essential to **stay adaptable and be ready to learn**. Your willingness to evolve and learn will keep you relevant and ahead of the curve.
        <h3>Challenge of Management (25:17)</h3>
        Lilly touches upon the massive responsibility that comes with being a first-time manager. **People leave their managers, not their jobs**. As you step into management roles, remember that you're setting the tone for someone's career. **Be a door opener** for your team and guide them, rather than merely instructing.
        <h3>Lift as You Climb (41:59)</h3>
        One of the most impactful insights Lilly offers is to **lift as you climb**. As you progress in your career, ensure you're helping and guiding those coming up behind you. Your journey should inspire and make a difference in someone else's path.
        If you are a junior developer, the overarching advice from Lilly's journey is to be curious, find mentors, adapt to the fast-paced tech world, and remember the responsibility that comes with every role. Most importantly, as you climb the ladder, always look back and extend your hand to help those following in your footsteps.
