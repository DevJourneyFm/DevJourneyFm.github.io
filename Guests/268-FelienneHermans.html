<div><h2>Highlights</h2>
    <p>
        <h3>Realizing Early Privileges (11:12)</h3>
        <b>Felienne</b> began her journey in the world of programming when she was gifted a computer early in her life. While many might think of it as an ordinary event, this was a significant privilege in that era. As she grew, she began to realize the importance of these early opportunities. She attended an elite high school that offered a <b>programming club</b>, a rare find in those days. This exposure to technology at a young age set the foundation for her interest in programming and gave her a significant head start in the tech world. <b>Realizing and acknowledging such privileges</b> is essential, as it offers perspective on one's journey and success.
        <h3>Importance of Adaptable Teaching Methods (13:53)</h3>
        Felienne shares her experiences as a teacher, emphasizing the significance of <b>adaptable teaching methods</b> that cater to each student's pace and level of understanding. She stresses that it's crucial to push students out of their comfort zones, even if they might not initially appreciate it. This tough love approach ensures that each student is challenged and encouraged to reach their full potential.
        <h3>Recognizing Your Unique Path and Learning from Failures (16:39)</h3>
        Throughout her career, Felienne faced challenges and moments of self-doubt. Yet, she learned the importance of <b>trusting her unique path and journey</b>. Comparing oneself with peers can lead to unnecessary pressure and can be detrimental. Everyone has their own pace of growth, and that's okay. Moreover, failures should be seen as <b>opportunities for learning and growth</b> rather than setbacks. By understanding and embracing failures, one can derive valuable lessons and insights that can shape a more robust future career.
        <h3>The Role of Coding in Education and Society (23:45)</h3>
        Felienne passionately discusses the role of coding in today's education system. She believes that coding is a fundamental skill, much like reading or arithmetic, and should be treated as such. The current method of introducing coding as an elective or after-school activity doesn't do justice to its importance. She emphasizes that coding is not just about becoming a programmer; it's about <b>understanding the digital world</b> we live in. For juniors, it's crucial to realize that coding is a tool for thinking and problem-solving and has applications far beyond traditional software development.
        <h3>Understanding the Real Value of Your Skills (29:50)</h3>
        While being passionate about a cause is essential, Felienne stresses the importance of aligning one's passions with tangible skills. For instance, while she cares deeply about climate change, she understands that her professional skills don't directly align with addressing this issue. Hence, it's vital for junior developers to <b>identify problems they are passionate about and possess the skills to solve</b>. This alignment ensures that one's efforts are directed effectively, leading to meaningful contributions.
        <h3>Choosing a Sustainable Career Path (46:29)</h3>
        When deciding on a career trajectory, Felienne advises considering three main factors: identifying a problem you care about, ensuring you have the skills to address it, and determining whether the chosen path is sustainable in the long run. It's not just about jumping into something because it's trendy or pays well. Instead, it's about <b>finding a balance between passion, skill, and sustainability</b>. This triad ensures a fulfilling career that not only brings satisfaction but also has a lasting impact.
