Jeff is a long-time serial entrepreneur and angel investor. Prior to Appcelerator, Jeff was Co-founder and CTO of Vocalocity, and CTO of digital incubator eHatchery. He has worked on numerous standard committees from IETF to W3C, and contributed to several open source technologies including JBoss and OpenVXI.

Jeff first told us how he went from coding games for fun, to selling software as a teenager, to solving problems on the deck of an aircraft carrier. We then talked about contracting and running a contracting business, and drifted toward entrepreneurship. Jeff finally told us the birth story of Titanium in 2006 and his new  startup pinpoint.
