<div><h2>Highlights</h2>
    <p>
        <h3>Challenges of Scaling (04:55)</h3>
        As his career progressed, Ori faced the challenges of scaling a company. The core issue was maintaining the company's culture during growth. He underscores the importance of **retaining the essence of the company's beginning stages** even as it expands. For junior developers in startups, it's crucial to understand and contribute positively to the company culture.
        <h3>Work-Life Balance (08:23)</h3>
        Ori stressed the importance of **finding a balance** between work and personal life. Even in demanding roles and hectic schedules, prioritizing time for family and oneself is crucial. This is a reminder for all developers to ensure they aren't losing themselves in the rush of deliverables and deadlines.
        <h3>Evolving with Tech (15:21)</h3>
        The world of software development is ever-evolving. Ori's journey from working with basic tools to more sophisticated ones like Linear B is a testament to **adapting with technological progress**. Developers, especially those starting out, should be open to continuous learning and embrace new technologies.
        <h3>Valuing Team Dynamics (22:34)</h3>
        No matter the product or service, Ori believes that **people and team dynamics are at the heart**. This belief influenced the creation of Linear B, aiming to help developers and managers understand team performance. For junior developers, it's essential to recognize their role within a team and the value of good team dynamics.
        <h3>Emphasizing Soft Skills (28:50)</h3>
        While technical expertise is essential, Ori places high value on **soft skills such as communication and empathy**. These are crucial, especially when transitioning from a developer role to a managerial one. Developers should focus on cultivating these soft skills alongside their technical prowess.
        <h3>The Dual Role of a Manager (34:15)</h3>
        Ori discussed the duality of a manager's role: ensuring the team's health and delivering the product. He suggests that focusing solely on product delivery can be detrimental. **A manager should strike a balance** between team well-being and achieving milestones. Junior developers should be aware of this balance when transitioning to leadership roles.
        <h3>The Power of Asking Questions (40:29)</h3>
        Ori encouraged the act of **being bold and asking questions**, no matter how trivial they might seem. This fosters understanding and clears any ambiguity. Junior developers shouldn't hesitate to seek clarifications and challenge the status quo when needed.
        <h3>Humility and Work Ethic (43:12)</h3>
        Highlighting the principle that "no work is beneath anyone," Ori emphasized humility and strong work ethic. Regardless of titles or positions, everyone should be willing to do what's needed for the team. Junior developers should embody this principle, showing willingness and **dedication in all tasks**.
        Junior developers can glean a wealth of knowledge from Ori Keren's experiences. From understanding the intricacies of scaling a tech company to the importance of soft skills and team dynamics, Ori's journey provides valuable insights for those starting their tech careers.
