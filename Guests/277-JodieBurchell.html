<div><h2>Highlights</h2>
    <p>
        On a recent podcast episode, we had the pleasure of hosting Dr. Jodie Burchell, a data science advocate at JetBrains, who shared her fascinating journey from a childhood fascination with palaeontology to leading data science teams in Europe. This journey was not linear but rather a winding road that led her through studying psychology and German in university to becoming a renowned figure in the field of data science.
    </p><p>
        Dr. Burchell started her journey with an aspiration to become a paleontologist, sparked by the classic movie, Jurassic Park. However, as she grew older, she found herself drawn more towards the humanities. This led her to university, where she initially studied history and German, before eventually transitioning to a dual degree in psychology and biology.
    </p><p> 
        In discussing her career transitions, Dr. Burchell provides valuable insights into the daunting yet rewarding process of career shifts. Her experiences in academia played a significant role in shaping her understanding of the profound impact data science can have in the real world. This led her to delve deeper into the field of data science, a field that is ever-evolving, with increasing specializations and a greater emphasis on developers with computer science and engineering backgrounds.
    </p><p>
        One of the most insightful parts of the discussion was Dr. Burchell's candid sharing of her transition from academia to industry. She highlighted the challenges she faced, such as her fear of the command line and insecurities about her engineering skills. Despite these challenges, she emphasized how this journey expanded her appreciation for the work of engineers.
    </p><p>
        Another intriguing part of her journey was her transition from academia to developer advocacy. Leaving academia allowed her to establish a healthier relationship with her job. She also shared how growing older has allowed her to care less about certain things, providing her with a more satisfying work experience.
    </p><p>
        Throughout the podcast, Dr. Burchell stressed the importance of multidisciplinary skills in data science. This point was underscored by her personal journey, which saw her navigate through various fields of study and work roles before finding her niche in data science. She concluded by discussing the challenges of being a technical team lead, managing both the business demands and the team's well-being, and the importance of continuously honing one's skills.
    </p><p>
        Dr. Jodie Burchell's journey is a testament to the power of curiosity, passion, and continuous learning. Her story serves as an inspiration to anyone in data science or considering it as a career. It underscores the fact that a meandering career path can lead to extraordinary places and that embracing new challenges can lead to unexpected fulfillment and purpose.
