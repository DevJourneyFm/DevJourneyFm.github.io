<p>Kapunahele talked about her going back and forth between technical studies and non-technical activities, between dancing, grammar of the roman languages, tech support and hardware repairs. She spoke about her love for esthetics and how she enjoys mathematical mental models of the world around her. We finally spoke about her work for the Angular.JS community and how she strives to make the open source community a more including, welcoming and kind place to be.</p><p>Kapunahele is a developer and Angular.JS fan who works on the Angular docs writing guides and developing example apps. She also enjoys Native Hawaiian practices, textile arts, and marveling at little, inconspicuous plants growing in forgotten places outdoors.<br><br><b>Here are the links of the show:</b></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.twitter.com/kapunahele">https://www.twitter.com/kapunahele</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/kapunahelewong/git-playground">https://github.com/kapunahelewong/git-playground</a></li><li>Kara Erickson <a href="https://twitter.com/karaforthewin">https://twitter.com/karaforthewin</a></li></ul><p><b>Credits</b></p><ul><li>Music <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Yung_Kartz/August_2018/Aye">Aye</a> by <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Yung_Kartz/">Yung Kartz</a> is licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License</a>.</li></ul><p><b>Your host</b><br><br>Software Developer‘s Journey is hosted and produced by Timothée (Tim) Bourguignon, a crazy frenchman living in Germany who dedicated his life to helping others learn &amp; grow.
